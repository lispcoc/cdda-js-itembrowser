# CCDA-JS-data-browser
 A browser-based tool to browse items of cataclysm: Dark days ahead. 



# Installing

## Windows:
- Drop the browser folder into your CDDA game directory.
- Run the .bat file. It will copy some data from your cataclysm game folder and run a lua script to transform the data into something this item browser can use.
- Open the index.html from the browser folder.
